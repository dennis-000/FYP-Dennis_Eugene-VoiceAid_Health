# VoiceAid Health  
### An Assistive Communication System for Speech‑Impaired Patients in Ghanaian Healthcare Settings

---

## 📌 Project Overview
**VoiceAid Health** is a mobile‑based assistive communication system designed to help **speech‑impaired individuals** communicate more effectively with caregivers, family members, and healthcare professionals. The system leverages **speech‑to‑text (ASR)**, **predictive intent suggestions**, **text‑to‑speech (TTS)**, and **visual phraseboards** to reduce communication barriers in hospitals and daily life.

The project is informed by real‑world requirements gathered from the **Speech and Language Therapy Unit at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital**, where it was identified that speech impairment varies widely in severity, pronunciation clarity, and communication strategies. As a result, the system focuses on **vocalization‑based assistance**, supported by **icons, suggested phrases, and caregiver involvement**, rather than gesture‑based interaction.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many speech‑impaired individuals—such as patients with cerebral palsy, stammering disorders, stroke‑related speech loss, or speech delays—struggle to communicate their needs clearly, especially in healthcare environments.

Existing communication systems often fail due to:
- Unclear pronunciation and distorted speech
- Repetition, stretching, or blocking of words
- Poor support for local Ghanaian languages
- Limited consideration for caregivers and therapists

This communication gap can lead to frustration, misinterpretation, and reduced quality of care.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
VoiceAid Health provides a **multimodal assistive communication platform** that enables users to express themselves clearly and efficiently. The system:
- Transcribes impaired speech into readable text
- Predicts the intended meaning of unclear speech
- Converts selected messages into clear synthesized speech
- Uses icons and predefined phrases to support understanding
- Supports caregivers in managing daily care routines and therapy tasks

The solution is designed for **both patients and the people around them**, recognizing that effective communication and therapy involve caregivers, family members, and healthcare professionals.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔹 Core Functionalities
- **Automatic Speech‑to‑Text (ASR)** for impaired speech  
- **Predictive Intent Suggestions** to clarify unclear utterances  
- **Text‑to‑Speech (TTS)** for audible communication  
- **Visual Phraseboard** with icons and commonly used phrases  
- **Daily Care Routine & Therapy Tasks Reminder**  
- **Caregiver Mode** for managing phrases, reminders, and preferences  
- **Accessibility‑Focused UI** (large buttons, high contrast, simple navigation)

---

## 🧠 System Design Philosophy
- Targets speech‑impaired users who can vocalize, even if speech is unclear
- Avoids gesture‑based interaction due to capture and accuracy limitations
- Focuses on **meaning prediction**, not perfect transcription
- Ensures a low learning curve for patients, caregivers, and healthcare staff
- Designed for future **machine‑learning model training** in local languages

---

## 🏥 Use Case Context
VoiceAid Health is intended for use in:
- Hospitals and clinics  
- Home‑based care environments  
- Speech therapy and rehabilitation sessions  
- Daily communication between patients and caregivers  

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (Planned / In Progress)
- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo)
- **Backend:** REST APIs (Node.js / Firebase – planned)
- **Speech Services:** External ASR APIs (temporary), custom ML models (future)
- **Design:** Figma (high‑fidelity UI and design system)
- **Machine Learning (Future):** Custom ASR models for Ghanaian languages (Twi, Ga)

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Personalized voice profile training per user
- Offline speech recognition support
- Additional local language support
- Therapist and caregiver web dashboard
- Detection of urgency or emotional cues from speech patterns

---

## 🎓 Academic Context
This project is developed as a **Final Year Project** under the **Department of Computer Science, Pentecost University**. It is informed by direct engagement with healthcare professionals at **Korle Bu Teaching Hospital**, ensuring real‑world relevance and practical applicability.
